# cashRegister
A project from freeCodeCamp for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects Developer Certification

This is the completed code from the cash register project from freeCodeCamp.  The actual work was done on FCC's website as part of the project.  All work is original.

I learned a lot working on this one in particular.  I had a huge problem with values being overwritten as the program ran and I could not figure out why.  Arrays that were not being modified in the code were being modified anyway and it made no sense.  Eventually I realized that I was passing arrays by reference instead of by value and was very rapidly able to get it working.  The frustration I experienced writing this should definitely drill into my head the difference between passing by reference and passing by value.
